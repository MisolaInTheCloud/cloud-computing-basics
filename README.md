#Compare Pricing Across Regions

Example: Letâ€™s compare the cost of storage across AWS, GCP, and Azure for different regions (e.g., US East vs. Europe vs. Asia).

Key Takeaways:

AWS is usually cheaper in US regions.

European and Asian regions are more expensive due to demand and infrastructure costs.

Google Cloud and Azure have similar pricing, with Azure sometimes being cheaper for Windows-based VMs.
